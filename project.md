the main purpose is to create a new, repurposed video by:
Importing a primary movie, often from YouTube or a local file.
Framing it with custom welcome messages, subtitles, and other audio commentary.
Adding supplementary visuals like AI-generated images or short video clips in the side players to create a unique composition.
Recording this entire playback session using the built-in screen recorder.
Saving the final recording to be re-uploaded, for example, back to YouTube.
